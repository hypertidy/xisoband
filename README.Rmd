The goal of xisoband is to make isoband a bit more generally useable. 


## Example

This example shows how to get the output of isoband as a *list of lists* of matrices, and to simply plot it. 


```{r example}
library(xisoband)
e <- whatarelief::elevation()
plot(iso <- xisoband::xisobands(e, extent = c(-180, 180, -90, 90)))
maps::map(add = TRUE, col = "firebrick", fill = FALSE)

ximage::ximage(e, extent = c(-180, 180, -90, 90))
plot(iso, add = TRUE)
```

We are using the hypertidy raster reader `elevation()` to get GEBCO 2021 elevation in a matrix, and ximage to plot it. The 'hypertidy way' is to specify `extent` directly when it is required, not a mix of xmin,xmax or xlim,ylim, or the degenerate rectlinear model used by `image()`. 

The orientation is *raster-order*, which is used by the GDAL packages and `rasterImage()`. There is a plot method for `isoband,iso` objects. 

We otherwise would get an unuseable list of grouped `x,y,id` lists from `isoband::isobands()`, or a list of `sfg` geometries (matrices in a list with a class for sf) with `iso_to_sfg()` that further processes the `isobands()` output . 

The plot method uses `graphics::lines()` currently, but could use the vectorized grid package plotting. It seems funny that isoband currently returns an output that requires further clean up, *and* converts to sf. 

We might contribute changes to isoband to clean this up, but first I needed to be able to explore what's already there. 

A rough set of goals: 

- [ ] add vectorized `grid` package plotting
- [ ] separate the raw `isobands()` output from the cleaned up version (in the same format)
- [ ] separate the conversion to sf
- [ ] put the geometry clean up deeper in the code, why do we want the raw `isobands()` output?, for example
